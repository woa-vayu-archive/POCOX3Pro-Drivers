## Surface Duo BSP - Version 2408.1 (Chucky)

> [!CAUTION]
> When booting windows for the second time, after the "Getting ready" phase, it is **Normal** for your device to end in a black screen
> DO NOT panic, DO NOT TRY TO FORCE REBOOT THE DEVICE! Leave it for 5 mins, press the power button once, or close it and reopen it, or plug in an usb cable and unplug it, do this as many times as you want, EVENTUALLY, the device will wake up. DO NOT try to reboot. Just try a few times and it will work, we promise it will not stay in a black screen. Just be a bit patient.

> [!NOTE]
> Higher thermals in Windows is currently expected and is not dangerous

### Full Flash Update Files

We're now providing FFU files directly from the release page outside of Telegram. The FFU files are also still uploaded on Telegram FFU channel, and they match this very specific release.

Learn more about FFU files: [FFU Flashing Guide](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/blob/main/InstallWindows/FlashingFFU.md)

Unfortunately, FFU files for this very version are not yet available. Download the FFU Files from the previous release alongside the previous release UEFI or come back later to this page for when the files will be uploaded.

### Release notes

>[!NOTE]
>This release includes both UEFI packages and Driver packages

Common:

- **New!** Pressing volume down in the UEFI will now bring in a boot menu allowing you to go back to android, go to android recovery, bootloader and more with ease

- **New!** The volume up button now launches the FFU Loader/UFP application in the UEFI for flashing FFU files. Previously this was bound to the Volume UP button.

- **New!** The SecureBoot enabled UEFI variable is now able to boot Windows 10X just fine

- **New!** Updated boot logo

- **New!** Windows 11 will now display an option to skip connecting to a wifi or cellular network during oobe by default.

Surface Duo (1st Gen):

- **New!** Improved panel detection and reporting in the operating system

- **New!** Resolved an issue leading to windows crash during specific windows updates

- **New!** AT&T users do not have to dump their modemst1/2 partitions anymore to have Cellular working ok in windows with non AT&T sims, this is now handled by the driver stack properly

- **New!** The driver stack is now 99% DCH compliant with Windows Core OS

- **New!** Updated the GPU Vulkan/OpenCL ICDs to build 59

- **New!** Tweaks to the digitizer configuration database, but nothing fully fixing the calibration just yet.

  <summary>Accessing Foldable Sensors from your applications</summary>
  <p>
In order to currently access the sensor data given by the foldable sensors, you need to use the following apis:


- Windows.Devices.Sensors.HingeAngleSensor*
- Windows.Internal.Devices.Sensors.FlipSensor* (2)
- Windows.Internal.System.TwoPanelHingePostureDevice* (2)


(2): These apis require the use of an externally sourced winmd available from https://github.com/ADeltaX/InternalWinMD/blob/master/%23winmd/Windows.Internal.Devices.Sensors.winmd


In the future, further apis will be functional (specifically under the Windows.System.Preview namespace). Consider this an early "thing".


The following API may be used to determine if your app is used on a dual screen device: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.windowingenvironment.getdisplayregions?view=winrt-22621

The following API may be used to determine on which display region your app is currently being shown: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.appwindow.getdisplayregions?view=winrt-22621

The following API may be used to move your application to the other display: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.appwindow.requestmoverelativetodisplayregion?view=winrt-22621

THe following API may be used to move your application to a specific display: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.appwindow.requestmovetodisplayregion?view=winrt-22621

The following API may be used for spanning purposes: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.appwindow.requestsize?view=winrt-22621

The Windowing Environment for Windows Desktop editions (outside of tablet mode) is Overlapped. Tiled is used for Tablet Mode and Windows Core OS's ModernPC.

### Dual Boot Information

<details>

*Important!*: The Dual Boot images currently target the following Android OTA update versions from Microsoft. These images _can only be used_ on a phone that had as latest the following OTA versions from microsoft *even if you are currently running a custom android system image*. Using these images will work *with a custom Android System Image* but the device *bootloader and firmware* must be from the same Microsoft OTA version as shipped from the stock Microsoft Android Updates!

| Device Name   | Device Variant                          | Dual Boot Compatible with the following firmware/bootloader version only |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Surface Duo   | United States of America (GEN)          | 2022.902.48  (Latest OTA for Surface Duo (1st Gen) devices)              |
| Surface Duo   | United States of America (AT&T)         | 2022.902.48  (Latest OTA for Surface Duo (1st Gen) devices)              |
| Surface Duo   | Europe (EEA)                            | 2022.902.48  (Latest OTA for Surface Duo (1st Gen) devices)              |
| Surface Duo 2 | United States of America (mmWave)       | 2023.501.202 (Latest OTA for Surface Duo 2 devices)               |
| Surface Duo 2 | Europe (5G NR)                          | 2023.501.202 (Latest OTA for Surface Duo 2 devices)               |

Flashing these images on any other version may brick your phone or render touch unusable! Make backups of your original boot partitions and ALWAYS test before flashing permanently using "fastboot boot image.img"!.

If you do not currently run above firmware versions, please also follow https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/blob/main/InstallWindows/DualBoot.md.

For more information on dual boot, manual steps on how to craft such image file, and how to flash it, and use it, please visit https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/blob/main/InstallWindows/DualBoot.md.

We do not recommend inexperienced users without advanced knowledge of IT/Command prompts to do this ever. You may find it very hard and mess up your device easily if you do it wrong. Also important to note Android OTAs will not work anymore with a custom boot.img flashed onto the device and you will need to reflash your original backup for them to work or else, you'll be forced to recover with an OTA zip package from https://aka.ms/sri if one is even available for your current version or higher.

<details>
  <summary>Some examples about what above warning means for you when running custom operating systems on your surface duo and if you are willing to run dual boot images</summary>
  <p>
To clarify above bullet point

If for example you flashed the Pixel Experience Android 13 Android System Image on your Surface Duo, and previously you were running Microsoft Stock Android OTA version 2022.123.45, your device firmware and bootloader are still version 2022.123.45 and will not be compatible with these images targeting 2022.902.48

In another example, you flashed the Pixel Experience Android 13 Android System Image on your Surface Duo, and previously you were running Microsoft Stock Android OTA version 2022.902.48, your device firmware and bootloader are still version 2022.902.48 and you are compatible with these images.

You are currently running stock microsoft android version 2022.902.48; you are compatible

You are currently not running stock microsoft android version 2022.902.48; you are not compatible

### Hey wow, that's a lot of UEFI images right here! Which one do I even download?

- FastBoot -> Image intended to be used with fastboot boot uefi.img to directly boot into the UEFI this way via your computer, use this one if you're following the installation guides right now
- Dual Boot -> Image intended to be flashed onto boot after checking compatibility with above table to make sure you meet the usability criteria and your device will work fine
- FD -> File needed to make your own custom dual boot images in case you do not meet the compatibility table, using the guide to do so (https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/blob/main/InstallWindows/DualBoot.md)

Use the files without SecureBoot Disabled in their filenames if and only if:
- I am booting a version of Windows higher than build 18363 (the latest Windows 10 feature update, Windows 11, Windows 11 Version 22H2 etc..)

Only use the files with SecureBoot Disabled in their filenames if and only if:
- I am booting Windows 10 build 18363 or lower on my device (Please also turn on testsigning in BCD in order to boot)
- I am booting Windows 10X on my device
- I am booting a linux distribution
